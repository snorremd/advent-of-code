# advent-of-code

Repository for Advent of Code solutions.
From now on I will just collect the yearly solutions here.
For 2020 I will again try to solve the tasks using Clojure.
This is because I'm not getting to do much Clojure in my day job, so this is a good change to practice it again.


## 2021

Solved using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).
To run in emacs or VSCode Calva open up the `2021` folder and jack-in.
To run from command line: `clj -M solutions/day5.clj`.
